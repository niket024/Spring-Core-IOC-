BeanPostProcessor 
--------------------
The BeanPostProcessor interface defines callback methods
that you can implement to provide your own instantiation logic, dependency-resolution logic, etc.
You can also implement some custom logic after the Spring container finishes instantiating, configuring, 
and initializing a bean by plugging in one or more BeanPostProcessor implementations.
