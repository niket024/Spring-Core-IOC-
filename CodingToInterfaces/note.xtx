Coding To Interfaces in Spring
----------------------------
creates interfaces to delineate expected functionality, and then implements these "contracts" in concrete classes.
 To use the interface one can simply call the methods on an instance of the concrete class.

The obvious benefit is knowing of the functionality provided by the concrete class,
irrespective of its specific implementation.
