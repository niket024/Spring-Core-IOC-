Event Handling in Spring
------------------------
Event handling in the ApplicationContext is provided through the ApplicationEvent class and ApplicationListener interface. 
Hence, if a bean implements the ApplicationListener,
then every time an ApplicationEvent gets published to the ApplicationContext, that bean is notified.

Spring provides the following standard events âˆ’
------------------------------------------
1. ContextRefreshedEvent
2. ContextStartedEvent
3. ContextStoppedEvent
4. ContextClosedEvent
5. RequestHandledEvent -(This is a web-specific event telling all beans that an HTTP request has been serviced.)
